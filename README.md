An updated take on the Theis Playlist Manager.
##History

[Theis Playlist Manager (TPM) was created by Aaron Forres](http://tpm.sourceforge.net/)t in 2003 for WPRB 103.3 FM, an independent radio station in Princeton, NJ. WPRB uses this software to create archives of its playlists and maintain its schedule.

Over the years, as people came and went with the station, the software fell into a state of disarray.

##The Future

Here's to hoping a new group of kindred spirits in technology can make this a state-of-the-art, open-source piece of software that radio stations big and small can use.
